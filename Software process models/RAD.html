			The RAD process
		</h1>
		<h2>
			Rapid application development (RAD) is an agile project management strategy popular in software development.
			The key benefit of RAD methodology is fast project turnaround, making it an attractive choice for developers working
             in a fast-paced environment like software development. This rapid pace is made possible by RADâ€™s 
            focus on minimizing the planning stage and maximizing prototype development.
			By reducing planning time and emphasizing prototype iterations, RAD allows project managers and stakeholders 
            to accurately measure progress and communicate in real time on evolving issues or changes. This results in greater efficiency, 
            faster development, and effective communication.
