				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<p>Global warming is characterised as long-term changes to 
                    planetary average weather patterns (National Geographic, n.d.) 
                    which have significant effects on local, regional and global climates 
                    (Nasa.gov, n.d.). Global warming is driven by human activity - specifically, 
                    fossil fuel use resulting in increased greenhouse gas levels raising Earthâ€™s average surface temperature 
                    (Nasa.gov, n.d.). Climate change caused by Global warming results in sea level changes linked to melting of 
                    polar ice sheets and glaciers causing widespread flooding and other forms of extreme weather such as intense droughts (National Geographic, n.d.).</p>
